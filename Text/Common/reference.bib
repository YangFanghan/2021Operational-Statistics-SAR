	abstract = {Remote Sensing is both an active research area and the source of valuable information for decision-making. Many actors play a fundamental role in Remote Sensing, from industry (public or private) to large or small research groups. From that intensive activity, methods, algorithms, and techniques are continuously published or broadcasted through papers, conference presentations, repositories, patents, standards, and other means. The consumers of that information need it to be readily available and dependable. Reproducible research can handle those needs. In this paper, we discuss two concepts: reproducibility and replicability in the context of Remote Sensing research. We propose a badging system suited to the specifics of the Remote Sensing community. Such a system aims at both recognizing the level of the reproducibility of the research, and to help increase its visibility. We show examples of reproducible research and provide clues to make easier the transition to the inevitable new times that embrace contemporary Science and Technology.},
